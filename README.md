 This is my hacker-themed hangman style game: HACKERMAN

 It plays like a normal hangman game. When you open the page, press any key to start the game. Then, press a key to guess that character. Correct guesses will reveal that character in the word, but incorrect guesses will cost you a turn, and that character is added to the list of incorrect guesses. If you repeat a guess, the game tells you. The game displays your wins, losses, how many incorrect guesses you have left, and what round you're on.

 HACKERMAN is a hollywood hacking themed game, with a word list of the 100 most common passwords, containing lowercase letters and numbers.

 Yes, I know that's not how hacking works.
